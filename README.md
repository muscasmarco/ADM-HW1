##Homework 1 - Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining

# Notes: 

1. A part of 'The Minion Game' solution was taken while opening the discussion 
board of the problem. Before that the game would terminate correctly for 
small sample strings, and fail (due to too much time elapsed) for longer ones. 

2. The Problem 2 solutions are all inside both scripts.py and 09-problem-2.py. I did not 
  divide them into multiple files as the challenges had 1 problem each. The challenges 
  from Problem 1 had multiple problems each, hence the subdivision in multiple files. 

3. All the scripts will be found inside scripts.py. 

4. The screenshots were taken as I unfortunately did not find the 'get PDF printout' option
  in Hackerrank submissions.
